                <p class="box">The anaconda is a semiaquatic snake found in tropical South America. The name applies to a several snakes in the genus Eunectes, but it is commonly used to refer to one species in particular â€“ the green anaconda.</p>
                <p class="box">When taking into account both weight and length, the green anaconda is the largest snake in the world, growing up to 9m long and weighing as much as 227kg. Picture it â€“ that's longer than six ten-year-olds lying head to foot, and heavier than all of them put together! </p>
                <p class="box">The green anaconda is a member of a family of snakes called constrictors. Constrictors are not venomous snakes, which means they don't kill prey by delivering venom through a bite. Instead, constrictors wrap their bodies around their prey and squeeze until it stops breathing â€“ yikes!</p>
                <p class="box">Once an anaconda has suffocated its victim, it's time to open wide. And boy does this snake have a gob on it! Stretchy ligaments allow it to open its mouth wide enough to swallow prey whole â€“ which could be large fish, rodents, caiman (relatives of crocodiles), wild pigs, small deer and even jaguars!</p>
                <p class="box">These snakes are primarily nocturnal, meaning they are active at night and sleep during the day. They hunt at night, swimming in the water with their eyes and nasal openings just above the water. The rest of their body remains hidden under the water as their eyes and nose is on the top of their heads. This allows them to sneak up on prey.</p>
                <p class="box">Anacondas like to be in or near water, and they are excellent swimmers. Their eyes and nostrils are on top of their heads, so they can keep their body hidden underwater as they wait for prey.</p>
